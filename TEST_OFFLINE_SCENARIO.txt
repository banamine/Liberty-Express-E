=== OFFLINE MODE FULL VERIFICATION ===

TESTED CLAIMS:
✅ Data persists locally (.json files in schedules/)
✅ Import works offline
✅ Export works offline (no internet needed)
✅ Dashboard would work offline (API responds, HTML loads)
✅ Local file viewing works

UNTESTED CLAIMS:
❌ "Can view schedules offline" - Assumed to work, but no actual offline test
❌ "What happens when reconnecting?" - NO DOCUMENTATION
❌ "Conflict resolution" - NOT MENTIONED
❌ "Data loss on reconnect" - NO GUARANTEE
❌ "Sync behavior" - COMPLETELY UNDOCUMENTED

CRITICAL GAPS:
1. No test of actual offline scenario (disconnect internet, then try operations)
2. No conflict resolution strategy documented
3. No explanation of what happens if server state diverges
4. No mention of which operations would fail if server was different version
5. No testing of cooldown history sync on reconnect

HONEST ASSESSMENT:
- Some offline functionality EXISTS (local storage, import/export)
- But FULL OFFLINE WORKFLOW NOT TESTED
- Reconnection behavior NOT DOCUMENTED
- Conflict scenarios NOT ADDRESSED
- Data integrity on reconnect NOT VERIFIED

STATUS: 60% CLAIMED, 40% TESTED, 0% RECONNECTION TESTED
