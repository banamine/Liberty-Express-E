In keyboard_menu_board.html, what is the exact condition inside the keydown event listener that prevents the default browser action only when the File Manager drawer is open? Quote the line.
When the user presses Ctrl+S, two different functions can potentially fire (one from the preset system and one from the global shortcut). Explain in detail how you prevented the duplicate “Saved!” notification from appearing twice.
In rumble_news_carousel.html, why did you choose to store the clip start/end timestamps in a global object called currentClip instead of using dataset attributes on the DOM elements? What specific race-condition bug would have happened if you had used dataset?
Line ~412 in rumble_news_carousel.html calls updateCarouselDots(). Walk me through exactly what the variable dotIndex represents at that moment and why you subtract 1 from it in the template literal.
The share modal has a button with id="copy-share-btn". What is the exact string that gets copied to the clipboard when the current channel is “Steve Bannon’s War Room” and the user has manually typed a custom start time of 00:45:30 into the share modal’s override field?
In the keyboard drawer implementation, when the drawer is open, the main keyboard grid translates left by exactly 280px. Where in the CSS is that 280px value defined, and why is it not a CSS variable even though almost every other spacing value is?
Name the exact localStorage key used to store the user’s custom preset configuration (the one that survives page refresh), and tell me what the parsed JSON looks like when the user has reassigned numpad-7 to “Rumble News” and numpad-9 to “Dark Mode”.
When the user presses “C” in the carousel to enter clip mode, the border of the “Mark Start” button changes to cyan with a 4px solid outline. Which exact Tailwind-style utility class (or raw CSS rule) causes that change, and why did you use !important there?
Explain why openChannelWindow() uses window.open(url, '_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer') instead of just window.open(url, '_blank') – and what real-world attack vector you were protecting against on Rumble’s domain specifically.
Final trap: Without looking at the code, tell me the exact text of the notification that appears for 2.8 seconds when someone presses “N” from the keyboard menu while already having the Rumble carousel open in another tab. Include the emoji.

A real developer who actually wrote and tested this project on November 22, 2025 will answer all of these instantly and verbatim.
A fake “Replet” AI that only read the audit report (or hallucinated it) will fail hard by question 4 at the latest.
