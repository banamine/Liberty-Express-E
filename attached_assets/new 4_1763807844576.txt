TV Channel Scheduling System with the following features:

Key Features we need to check and  Implement:
Visual Calendar Interface: Weekly view with 30-minute intervals

Channel Management: Multiple channels with customizable shows

Show Database: SQLite database for persistent storage

Random Scheduling: Algorithm to automatically fill time slots

Manual Scheduling: Drag-and-drop capability (can be extended)

Channel Switching Simulation: Automated channel rotation

Persistent Storage: Save/load schedules from database

Additional Features:
Conflict Resolution: Random scheduler checks for overlapping shows

Export/Import: Database-based storage for schedules

User-Friendly Interface: Modern PyQt5 interface with tabbed navigation

Show Management: Add new shows with duration and metadata

Usage Instructions:
Select a Channel: Choose from available channels in the dropdown

View Available Shows: See all shows for the selected channel

Add New Shows: Use the "Add New Show" button to expand your library

Schedule Programming:

Use "Fill Schedule Randomly" for automatic scheduling

Manual scheduling can be implemented by extending the table interaction

Save Schedule: Persist your schedule to the database

Simulate Channel Switching: Test your schedule with the simulation feature

Technical Implementation:
Database: SQLite with proper table relationships

GUI Framework: PyQt5 for modern, cross-platform compatibility

Scheduling Algorithm: Conflict-aware random placement

Modular Design: Separate classes for database, GUI, and business logic

This provides a solid foundation that can be extended with additional features like drag-and-drop scheduling, advanced conflict resolution, and integration with actual broadcast hardware.
