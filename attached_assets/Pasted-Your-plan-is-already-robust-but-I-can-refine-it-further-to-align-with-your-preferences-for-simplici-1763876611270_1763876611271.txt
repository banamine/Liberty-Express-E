Your plan is already robust, but I can refine it further to align with your preferences for simplicity, local control, and minimal dependencies. Here’s a **simplified, streamlined version** of your workflow, emphasizing **local-first development** and **zero unnecessary complexity**:

### **Simplified Free Static Site Hosting Playbook**
**Core Idea:** Use **GitHub Pages** for global hosting and **your PC** for development/testing. No paid services, no complex setups—just a clean, automated workflow.

---

### **Phase 1: Setup (5 Minutes)**
#### **1. Create a GitHub Repository**
- Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create a new public repository (e.g., `my-static-site`).
- **Public repos are required for free GitHub Pages hosting.**

#### **2. Initialize Your Project Locally**
- Open **VS Code** (or your preferred editor).
- Create a folder for your project and initialize Git:
  ```bash
  mkdir my-static-site
  cd my-static-site
  git init
  ```
- Add your static files (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.) to this folder.

#### **3. Connect to GitHub**
- Link your local folder to the GitHub repo:
  ```bash
  git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-static-site.git
  git branch -M main
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  git push -u origin main
  ```

---

### **Phase 2: Local Development (No Surprises)**
#### **Test Your Site Locally**
- Use Python’s built-in server for quick, reliable testing:
  ```bash
  python -m http.server 8000
  ```
- Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
- **No extra tools needed.** Test thoroughly before deploying.

---

### **Phase 3: Automate Deployment (One-Click Free Hosting)**
#### **Enable GitHub Pages**
1. Go to your repo on GitHub.
2. Navigate to **Settings > Pages**.
3. Under **Source**, select the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
4. Click **Save**. Your site will be live at `https://your-username.github.io/my-static-site` within minutes.

#### **Optional: Automate with GitHub Actions (For Frameworks)**
If you’re using React, Vue, etc., uncomment the build steps in the workflow below. Otherwise, skip this—GitHub Pages will serve your static files directly.

1. Create a file at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` in your project:
   ```yaml
   name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
   on:
     push:
       branches: ["main"]
   permissions:
     contents: read
     pages: write
     id-token: write
   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout
           uses: actions/checkout@v4
         # Uncomment if using a framework (e.g., React):
         # - name: Setup Node.js
         #   uses: actions/setup-node@v4
         #   with:
         #     node-version: '18'
         # - name: Install dependencies
         #   run: npm ci
         # - name: Build
         #   run: npm run build
         - name: Upload artifact
           uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
           with:
             path: '.'  # Or './build' if using a framework
         - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
           uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
   ```
2. Push the workflow file to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow"
   git push
   ```

---

### **Your Workflow in Action**
1. **Code:** Edit files locally in VS Code.
2. **Test:** Run `python -m http.server 8000` and check `http://localhost:8000`.
3. **Deploy:** Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update site"
   git push
   ```
   - GitHub Pages updates automatically.
   - Your site is live at `https://your-username.github.io/my-static-site`.

---

### **Why This Works for You**
- **No complex setups:** Uses GitHub’s native features.
- **Local-first:** Develop and test entirely on your PC.
- **Zero cost:** No hidden fees or dependencies.
- **Automated:** Push to `main` = instant deployment.
