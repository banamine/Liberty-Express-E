Core Concept:
A customizable GUI where users create, place, and toggle transparent info bubbles (panels) via drag-and-drop. Each bubble displays titles, text, extras (e.g., metadata, status), and can be turned on/off from a page menu/schedule panel. A sleek clock/date display is always visible at the top.

Key Features
1. Drag-and-Drop Bubbles

Transparent Panels: Semi-transparent bubbles with clean text layout (titles, subtitles, extras).
Freely Placeable: Users drag bubbles anywhere on the GUI and resize them.
Snap-to-Grid (Optional): Light grid for alignment (toggleable in settings).

2. Content Display

Structured Layout:

Title (bold, top-aligned).
Body Text (readable font, left-aligned).
Extras (e.g., timestamps, icons, status indicators).


Themes: Light/dark mode; font size/color customization.

3. On/Off Toggle

Page Menu: Right-click or sidebar menu to show/hide bubbles.
Schedule Panel: Users set bubbles to appear/disappear at specific times (e.g., "Show 'Weather' bubble at 7 AM").

4. Persistent Clock/Date

Top-Bar Display: Always visible, minimalist design (e.g., 14:30  •  Nov 18, 2025).
Customizable: 12/24-hour format, font, and position (top-left/right/center).

5. User-Created Panels

Add New Bubble: Button in the menu to create custom bubbles (name, content, size, transparency).
Templates: Pre-designed bubbles (e.g., "Notes," "Tasks," "Media Player").
Save/Load Layouts: Users save bubble arrangements and reload them later.


UI Rules

Visibility: No critical buttons or text cut off; bubbles auto-adjust for readability.
Aesthetics: Consistent padding, rounded corners, subtle shadows for depth.
Performance: Smooth drag-and-drop (60 FPS), no lag with 10+ bubbles.


Example Workflow

User drags a "Weather" bubble from the menu onto the GUI.
Resizes it and sets transparency to 80%.
Toggles it off in the page menu (hides until scheduled).
Clock/date remains visible at the top, updating in real time.


Clarification Needed:

Should bubbles support rich text (bold/italics/links) or just plain text?
Do you want animations (e.g., fade-in on toggle) or static transitions?
