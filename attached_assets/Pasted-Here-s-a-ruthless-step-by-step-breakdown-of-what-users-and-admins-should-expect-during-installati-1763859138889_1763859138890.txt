Here’s a ruthless, step-by-step breakdown of what users (and admins) should expect during installation, usage, and configuration—along with hard questions about gaps, assumptions, and potential failures:

1. Installation: What to Expect
User Flow:


First: Clone the Repo

git clone https://github.com/[org]/ScheduleFlow.git
Question: Is there a release package (e.g., .zip) for non-developers?


Second: Dependencies

Claim: "Zero external dependencies."
Reality?

Node.js (for Express.js) is required.
Python 3.x (for M3U_Matrix_Pro.py) is required.

Question: Are these dependencies documented? (e.g., README.md with version requirements?)


Third: Setup

Run npm install (for Express).
Run pip install -r requirements.txt (for Python).
Question: Are there hidden dependencies (e.g., system libraries for XML parsing)?


Fourth: Configuration

Edit config/settings.json (e.g., ports, CORS).
Question: Is there a setup script or manual config?


Fifth: Launch

node api_server.js (starts Express).
python M3U_Matrix_Pro.py (starts Python engine).
Question: Is there a single command to start everything? (e.g., docker-compose up?)


2. First Launch: What Users See
Step-by-Step UI Flow:


First: Splash Screen?

Claim: None mentioned in docs.
Question: Does it load instantly or hang? (e.g., waiting for Python to initialize?)


Second: Login/Permissions?

Claim: No auth system mentioned.
Question: Who is this for? (Public vs. private use?)


Third: Dashboard

Claim: interactive_hub.html loads with:

Import modal.
Schedule modal.
Calendar view.

Question: Is the UI intuitive? (e.g., labels for "Import XML" vs. "Export JSON"?)


Fourth: Auto-Load Playlist?

Claim: "Auto-fill" in schedule modal.
Question: Does it auto-play videos? Or just display them?


Fifth: TV Guide Integration

Claim: "Import TVGuide XML/JSON."
Question: Is there a real demo of this working? (e.g., screenshot or video?)


3. Core Functionality: Hard Questions
A. Playlist & Schedule

Auto-Play?

Question: Does the playlist auto-play in the browser? Or is it a static preview?

TV Guide Slide-In?

Question: Is the TV guide hardcoded or dynamic? (e.g., drag-and-drop?)

Demo Examples?

Question: Where are real working examples? (e.g., sample XML/JSON files?)

B. Panels & Workflow

How Many Panels Stay Open?

Risk: Is the UI cluttered? (e.g., 5+ modals open at once?)

Auto-Load Playlist?

Question: Does it auto-load from a default file? Or require manual upload?

C. Online vs. Offline

Online Mode:

Question: Does it sync with a cloud? (e.g., Google Drive, S3?)

Offline Mode:

Question: Does it work at all without internet? (e.g., local file storage only?)


4. Admin Security & Access Control
Critical Gaps:


No Auth System?

Risk: Anyone can delete schedules or inject malicious XML.
Question: How will admins restrict access?


Security Doors?

Proposal:

Add role-based access (e.g., admin, editor, viewer).
Hide "Delete All Schedules" from viewers.

Question: Where will these permissions live? (e.g., config/security.json?)


VS Code + GitHub?

Question: Is this only for developers? Or should non-tech users edit configs?
