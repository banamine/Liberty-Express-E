Here’s a clear, actionable, and user-focused rewrite of your requirements for a UI-based manual handle mapping system with drag-and-drop, customizable workbenches, and guided help. This version is structured for both developers and end-users, with explicit directions and use cases.

UI Design Specifications: Manual Handle Mapping & Customizable Workbench
Overview
This UI allows users to manually map handles (e.g., Rumble channels) and customize their workbench with drag-and-drop panels, notepad integration, and guided setup. It includes a demo mode for quick testing and a help system for step-by-step guidance.

Core Features
1. Manual Handle Mapping UI
Purpose: Enable users to add or edit handles (e.g., Rumble channels) manually.
Key Requirements:

One-time setup: Users can add new handles via a simple form.
Database integration: Pre-loaded with 30 existing channels; new additions are saved to the database.
Search & filter: Quickly find handles by name, ID, or status.

UI Elements:

Add Handle Button: Opens a modal form for entering handle details (name, URL, category, etc.).
Edit/Delete Buttons: Inline actions for each handle in the list.
Bulk Import: Option to upload a CSV or JSON file for multiple handles.


2. Customizable Workbench
Purpose: Provide a flexible workspace with closable, draggable panels and notepad functionality.
Key Requirements:

Drag-and-Drop Panels: All panels (e.g., handle list, notepad, demo templates) can be rearranged or closed.
Notepad Integration: Every workbench includes a built-in notepad for notes, code snippets, or to-do lists.
Save/Load Layouts: Users can save their panel arrangements and reload them later.

UI Elements:

Panel Header:

Close Button (X): Closes the panel.
Drag Handle (⠿): Allows repositioning.
Minimize/Maximize: Toggles panel size.


Notepad Panel:

Rich text support.
Save/export notes as .txt or .md.




3. Help System with Guided Setup
Purpose: Assist users in setting up pages perfectly with minimal effort.
Key Requirements:

Interactive Help Menu: Accessible via a Help Button (always visible).
Checkbox-Driven Setup: Users select options (e.g., "Add Notepad," "Enable Demo Mode") to semi-automate page creation.
Suggestion Bubbles: Contextual tips appear as users interact with the UI (e.g., "Drag panels here to customize your layout").

UI Elements:

Help Button: Opens a sidebar or modal with:

Step-by-Step Guides: Visual walkthroughs for common tasks.
Checkbox Options:

"Enable Notepad"
"Load Demo Templates"
"Auto-arrange Panels"
"Show Advanced Options"


Searchable FAQ: Quick answers to common questions.


Suggestion Bubbles: Pop-up tips that appear when hovering over buttons or panels.


4. Demo Mode
Purpose: Let users test the UI with pre-loaded content.
Key Requirements:

Demo Button: Instantly loads 6 demo templates (e.g., "Big Buck Bunny," "Sample Rumble Videos").
Demo Output Folder: All demo-generated files are saved to a dedicated folder (/demo_output/).
Reset Option: Clears demo content and restores the default layout.

UI Elements:

Demo Button: Located in the top toolbar.
Template Selector: Dropdown to choose from 6 demo options.
Output Preview: Shows a thumbnail grid of demo videos/pages.


UI Layout Rules

Visibility:

All buttons and critical actions must be visible without scrolling.
Use collapsible sections for advanced options.


Panel Management:

Panels can be dragged to any position on the screen.
Closed panels can be reopened from a "Panel Library" in the help menu.


Responsive Design:

Works on screens as small as 1280x720.
Panels resize dynamically when the window is adjusted.




Example Workflow

User opens the UI → Sees a default layout with the handle list and a notepad.
Clicks "Help" → Sidebar opens with checkboxes for customization.
Selects "Load Demo Templates" → 6 demo videos appear in a grid.
Drags the "Demo Output" panel → Moves it to the right side of the screen.
Clicks "Add Handle" → Fills out the form and saves a new Rumble channel.
Uses the notepad → Jots down notes about the new handle.


Technical Notes for Developers

Frontend: Use a framework like React or Vue for drag-and-drop (e.g., react-dnd or vue-draggable).
Backend: Store handle data in a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite or Firebase).
Demo Content: Host sample videos locally or use placeholder URLs.
Help System: Implement a state machine to track user progress and trigger suggestion bubbles.


Next Steps

Design Mockups: Create wireframes for the workbench, help menu, and demo mode.
Prototype: Build a minimal version with drag-and-drop panels and the help system.
User Testing: Gather feedback on the demo mode and checkbox-driven setup.
