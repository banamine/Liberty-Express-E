Scenario A: Hybrid Rumble Handle Manager with Bubble UI
1. Core Structure


Traditional Handle Manager:
A classic form/table-based interface for adding, editing, and managing Rumble handles (channels).

Forms: Input fields for handle details (name, URL, category, etc.).
Tables: Sortable/filterable list of handles with inline edit/delete buttons.
Buttons: "Add Handle," "Bulk Import," "Save Changes."



Bubble Display:
A separate, dynamic overlay for visually showcasing channel info on-screen.

Bold text, accent colors, and customizable fonts for emphasis.
Fade-in/fade-out effects for smooth transitions when bubbles appear/disappear.




2. Themes & Output Pages


Theme Selector:

Pre-loaded themes (e.g., Dark, Light, High-Contrast, Neon).
Dark theme preferred by default (customizable via settings).
Themes apply to both the handle manager and bubble displays for consistency.



Output Page Customization:

Users select a theme, and it auto-applies to all bubbles and tables.
Live preview of theme changes before saving.




3. Transparent Bubble Workbench


Everything is a Bubble:

Handle mapping, notepad, media player, and settings are all contained in draggable, resizable, transparent bubbles.
Bubbles can be minimized, closed, or pinned to the workbench.



Template Wiring:

Users select a template (e.g., "Streamer Dashboard," "Analyst View") from a dropdown.
The template auto-arranges bubbles (e.g., notepad + handle list + media player).
Checkbox panel lets users toggle which bubbles to include (e.g., "Show Notepad," "Hide Stats").



Add Text & Custom Content:

Right-click any bubble to "Add Text" (supports rich text: bold, italics, links).
Dynamic content (e.g., live channel stats, notes) updates in real time.




4. Visual & Functional Rules

Bubble Design:

Rounded corners, subtle drop shadows, adjustable transparency (10%-90%).
Color-coded borders for different bubble types (e.g., blue for handles, green for notes).


Animations:

Fade-in/fade-out when bubbles appear/disappear (200ms duration).
Smooth drag-and-drop with snap-to-grid option.


Workbench Layout:

Save/load layouts (e.g., "Streaming Mode," "Editing Mode").
Reset to default with one click.




Example Workflow

User opens the traditional handle manager to add a new Rumble channel via form.
Switches to bubble mode and selects the "Streamer Dashboard" template.
The template auto-loads bubbles for handle list, notepad, and live stats.
User drags the notepad bubble to the left, resizes it, and sets transparency to 70%.
Adds a custom text bubble with bold, colored notes about the channel.
Toggles off the stats bubble via the checkbox panel (fade-out effect).
Saves the layout as "My Streaming Setup."


Clarify:

Should bubbles support embedded media (e.g., thumbnails, live previews
