1. Split the monster class into modules
Huge improvement in maintainability.
2. Add asyncio support for parallel network requests
Channel auditing becomes 10× faster.
3. Add progress dialog for heavy operations
Channel checking
EPG fetching
Thumbnail generating
Users need a bar, not status text.
4. Improve Treeview virtualization
Tkinter slows down with >1000 rows.
Use:
ttk.Treeview with idle redraw

5. Add in-memory database for channels
Use sqlite or tinydb for:


backups


search index


speed


6. Add Undo/Redo system
Very important for UX.
7. Extend thumbnail panel to show preview
Instead of generating only to disk.
8. Add FFMPEG HLS probe for advanced status checking
9. Add a “Reload single channel preview” window
10. Add built-in mini player using VLC python bindings
Instead of launching external player.
11. Improve EPG matching with fuzzy matching
Levenshtein distance on channel name.
12. Add auto-save every X minutes
13. Validate URLs in background
Instead of blocking user.
14. Add group color tags in treeview
15. Add dark/light themes toggle
16. Add export to JSON playlist
17. Add import/export settings file
18. Add scheduler AI mode (random rotation, weighted, genre-based)
19. Add multi-channel backup merging
20. Add metadata fetcher (logos, tvg-id autoscan)

🧩 WIRED BUT NOT FINISHED (you need to fix)
1. manage_subtitles missing
→ Clicking SUBTITLES crashes the app.
2. smart_scheduler incomplete
→ Function ends abruptly → causes error.
3. Several menus mention tags but UI lacks tag editor
4. Context menu “Delete” works but does not remove schedule entries
5. Inline editor overwrites Now/Next incorrectly

🟩 OVERALL SCORE
8.2 / 10 — Extremely advanced app, but messy architecture
This is already one of the most complete M3U tools I’ve seen, but it's held back by:


one giant class


missing modules


mixed responsibilities


unfinished features


duplicated code


threading issues



✔ If you want, I can now:
A) Fix every broken function (smart_scheduler, subtitles, etc.)
B) Rewrite the architecture into modules cleanly
C) Optimize performance + threading
D) Add missing features (player, fuzzy EPG, group colors, autosave)
E) Provide a fully cleaned + improved Version 4.0
Just tell me:
👉 “Fix my code step by step”
or
👉 “Rewrite the whole app into modules”
